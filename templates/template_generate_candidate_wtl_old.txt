You are an experienced database expert specializing in project management and employee performance analysis systems.

The database structure is defined by the following table schemas, with special attention to examples and foreign key relationships that help identify the correct columns and relationships.

Database admin instructions (violating these will result in significant query issues):

1. String Matching Requirements:
   - For employee names: ALWAYS use (name LIKE '%value%' OR alias LIKE '%value%' OR name LIKE '%english/chinese_equivalent%')
   - For departments: ALWAYS use (department LIKE '%value%' OR subdepartment LIKE '%value%')
   - For project/team names: ALWAYS check both project.name AND team.name when searching project-related information (e.g., project.name LIKE '%value%' OR team.name LIKE '%value%')
   - For all project-related queries: ALWAYS check both project.uuid AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM team WHERE team.uuid = project.team_id AND team.name LIKE '%value%')
   - Never use exact string matches (=) for text fields unless specified in hints

2. Join Requirements:
   - Use proper table aliases (T1, T2, T3, etc.)
   - Join teams and projects correctly via team_id
   - For employee performance: outer join work_hour with projects 
   - Handle NULL values in optional relationships

3. Date Handling:
   - Use STRFTIME for date standardization
   - Handle multiple date formats consistently
   - Consider NULL dates in calculations
   - Filter from start_date in work_hour unless otherwise specified
   - For "last week" queries: Calculate based on most recent completed Monday-to-Sunday period

4. Aggregation Rules:
   - For project revenue: Handle NULL revenue values
   - Group by appropriate level (team, department, client)
   - When querying subdepartments: ALWAYS group by both department AND subdepartment
   - For average work hours: 
        * First SUM all entries per employee
        * Then calculate average across employees
        * Never calculate averages directly from work_hour entries

5. Performance Optimization:
   - Use INNER JOIN when relationship must exist
   - Use LEFT JOIN for optional relationships
   - Add IS NOT NULL checks for critical calculations

6. Employee Context Handling:
   - Only include employee_id conditions when the query specifically requires personal data
   - For personal queries (my tasks, my hours): Include employee_id filters
   - For general queries (team stats, client analysis): Omit employee_id even if provided
   - Never add employee_id conditions unless explicitly needed for personal data access

7. Labor Cost Calculations:
   A. Precise Labor Cost (for completed projects/quarters):
      - Calculate quarterly total hours per employee: SUM(work_hour.hour) GROUP BY employee_id
      - Monthly hours = quarterly_total / 3
      - Individual labor cost = salary / (monthly_hours)
      - Include date range filters for quarter boundaries
      - Use for completed projects and financial reporting

   B. Estimated Labor Cost (for ongoing projects):
      - Monthly Estimation:
        * Calculate total_hours and total_employees for the period
        * Use AVG(salary) for average_monthly_salary
        * Estimated hourly cost = average_monthly_salary / (total_hours/total_employees)
      
      - Weekly Estimation:
        * Same as monthly but divide average_salary by 4 for weekly rate
        * Use appropriate date ranges for week calculations
        * Use for quick budget forecasting

   C. Implementation Requirements:
      - Always include error handling for division by zero
      - Round results to 2 decimal places using ROUND()
      - Handle NULL values in salary and hour calculations
      - Use appropriate date ranges based on query context
      - Include appropriate GROUP BY clauses for aggregations

8. Last Week Date Handling:
   - For queries involving "last week", determine week boundaries based on Monday-to-Sunday periods
   - Base calculations on the most recently completed Monday-to-Sunday period
   - Use STRFTIME functions for consistent date handling

【Question】
For ongoing projects (有进行中的项目), analyze the timeline efficiency: show project progress (elapsed time vs expected duration), resource utilization (actual hours vs projected hours based on area), team composition changes, and identify potential timeline risks.

【Evidence】
ongoing projects refers to expected_completion_date > CURRENT_DATE; elapsed time = JULIANDAY('now') - JULIANDAY(sign_date); expected duration = JULIANDAY(expected_completion_date) - JULIANDAY(sign_date); projected hours based on area = area * 1.5 (standard ratio)

【Question】
Show the performance metrics for last week: total projects active, total work hours, revenue generated, and team participation. Note that our weeks run from Tuesday to Tuesday.

【Evidence】
last week refers to previous completed Tuesday-Tuesday period; active projects means has work hours in the period; team participation means COUNT(DISTINCT team_id); use SQLite date functions

**************************
【Answer】
Repeating the question and evidence, and generating the SQL with Recursive Divide-and-Conquer.

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** Calculate last week's performance metrics including labor costs
    * **Analysis:** Need to properly define Tuesday-Tuesday period and calculate metrics
    * **Pseudo SQL:** WITH date_range, active_projects, weekly_metrics, labor_costs

【Question】
Calculate the precise quarterly labor cost for Q1 2024, estimated monthly labor cost for March 2024, and weekly labor cost for last week. Show the calculations for project 'Design System' and break down by department.

【Evidence】
Q1 2024 refers to start_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-03-31'; March 2024 refers to start_date BETWEEN '2024-03-01' AND '2024-03-31'; last week refers to previous completed week; Design System project refers to (project.name LIKE '%Design System%' OR EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM team WHERE team.uuid = project.team_id AND team.name LIKE '%Design System%'))

**************************
【Answer】
Repeating the question and evidence, and generating the SQL with Recursive Divide-and-Conquer.

**1. Divide and Conquer:**

* **Main Question:** Calculate three types of labor costs
    * **Analysis:** Need separate CTEs for each calculation type, with proper project identification
    * **Pseudo SQL:** WITH project_ids, quarterly_costs, monthly_costs, weekly_costs

    * **Sub-question 1:** Identify relevant projects first
        * **Analysis:** Check both project names and team names
        * **Pseudo SQL:** WHERE project.name LIKE '%value%' OR team.name LIKE '%value%'

    * **Sub-question 2:** Calculate costs with identified projects
        * **Analysis:** Use identified project IDs for all subsequent calculations
        * **Pseudo SQL:** JOIN with project_ids CTE
